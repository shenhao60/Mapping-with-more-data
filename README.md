# Mapping with more data

In this assignment, three parts have been done:

1. [Report](https://shenhao60.github.io/Mapping-with-more-data/Mapping-with-more-data.html), which is created by rmarkdown with HTML format. It contains basic idea of how I try to create shiny app.
2. [Slide](https://shenhao60.github.io/Mapping-with-more-data/Berries-slide.html), which is transformed from berries homework with new revealjs output method. Since it has already contains headings, lists, formulas and tables, I just kept its content as before.
3. [Shiny app](https://haoshen.shinyapps.io/Hurricane-shiny/), which shows the results with additional data from FEMA. You can choose the layer to plot and which layer should be displayed on the map.
